                <p>
                    Welcome to the homepage of Nicholas Georgiou! I am an undergraduate student at
                    <a href="https://ephx.ku.edu/">The University of Kansas</a>, pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Engineering Physics with a concentration in Aerospace Systems.
                    My studies sit at the intersection of Physics and Aerospace Engineering, as I am constantly bouncing from department to department. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Apart from academics, I have a variety of hobbies. Whether itâ€™s teeing off on the golf course, carving down snowy slopes, catching waves, or trekking through the mountains, I love sharing these experiences with friends and family while embracing the outdoors.
                    For some highlights, check out my <a href="adventures.html">Adventures</a> page.

        <h2>Undergraduate Journey</h2>
        <p>
            My research journey began during my sophomore year at Dr. Chao's <a href="https://cusl.ku.edu/Main_Page">Cooperative Unmanned Systems Laboratory (CUSL) </a>, where I focused on developing high-frequency RPM data logging systems and dynamic thrust models for Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS).
            The research objective is to better capture thrust data during controlled fire burns, more specifically when the UAS interferes with fire plume clouds.
            This research has exposed me to the world of flight computer firmware, where I am currently modifying and implementing custom code for my proposed system.
     
        </p>

        <p>
            During my junior year, I joined NASA Langley Research Center as a Composites Engineering Intern in the <a href="https://ampb.larc.nasa.gov/?doing_wp_cron=1734974500.3065140247344970703125">Advanced Maeterials and Processing Branch</a>.
            There, I fabricated composite wingboxes, implemented advanced bonding techniques, and conducted ultrasonic testing for non-destructive evaluation.
            My work extended to designing and machining composite molds as well as synchronizing data from ultrasonic scans with autoclave cure cycles.
        </p>

        <p>
            Now I am currently back at The University of Kansas for my last semesters. Stay tuned for updates on my capstone projects as I plan to update this page with the plans!
