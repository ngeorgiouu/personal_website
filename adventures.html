        <h3>End of Summer 2024 Roadtrip</h3>
        <p>
            At the end of Summer of 2024, I traversed the pacific northwest, headed east to Montana, dipped down into Wyoming and Utah, seeing everything possible with my two best friends, one tent named 'Green Grommet', and a jeep.
            Seriously some of the most fun I have ever had. Here are some special photos and moments captured during the trip.

        <h3>Cyprus 2023 Family Trip</h3>
        <p>
            I feel fortunate to have visited my dad's home country, Cyprus, where my grandmother and one of his sisters currently live.
            Located in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea, Cyprus is an island of stunning natural beauty. From its crystal-clear beaches and rugged coastlines to its lush, forested mountains, Cyprus truly has it all.
            Beyond its breathtaking landscapes, the island holds a special place in my heart because of its deep connection to my dad's history.
            Here are some pictures from my most recent visit during the summer of 2023.
        </p>

                <img src="Images/Cyprus_yiayia.JPEG" alt="YiaYia">
                <p>
                    A photo with my Yiayia, sister, and cousin during a lovely outdoor lunch at my dad's sister's house.

                <p>
                    Taken atop of Moutti tis Sotiras. This hike started out on the northeast tip of Cyprus near the shoreline. My sister and I climbed up the mountain to watch the sun set over the water. Remarkable.

                    A photo taken at Cape Cavo Greco with my lovely mom and dad. Located in the southeastern corner of Cyprus, this rugged peninsula boasts cliffside hikes and a stunning turquoise lagoon.
