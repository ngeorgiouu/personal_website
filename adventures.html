        <h2>My Adventures</h2>
        <p>
            A collection of some of my favorite adventures—moments from the places I've been lucky enough to explore with friends and family. Grateful for every mile, memory, and map pin.
            Here’s to wherever the next one leads.
        </p>

        <h3>Beginning of Summer 2025 Rock Climbing Trip</h3>
        <p>
            Only have gone to the climbing gym once, I was invited to rock climb in the Red River Gorge. Meeting my old NASA friends Finn, Callahan, and Dave, we got active in the Gorge.
            There is a first time for everything, and I was glad to have friends who got me out there!

        <h3>End of Summer 2024 Roadtrip</h3>
        <p>
            As Summer 2024 came to a close, I set off across the Pacific Northwest with my two lifelong friends, a battered tent named ‘Green Grommet,’ and Henry’s Jeep that carried more memories than miles. We crossed into Montana, dipped into Wyoming and Utah, and let the road decide the rest.
            It was a snapshot of youth—pure, unscripted, and unforgettable. Here are a few glimpses into that perfect chaos.

        <h3>Cyprus 2023 Family Trip</h3>
        <p>
            I feel incredibly grateful to have visited Cyprus—my dad’s home country and the place where my grandmother and one of his sisters still live. Nestled in the eastern Mediterranean, the island is a stunning blend of crystal-clear beaches, rugged coastlines, and forested mountains. But beyond its natural beauty, Cyprus holds deep meaning for me. It’s a piece of my family's story, a connection to where my dad came from.
            These photos are from my most recent trip in the summer of 2023—a visit I’ll always hold close.

                    Taken atop of Moutti tis Sotiras. This hike started out on the northeast tip of Cyprus near the shoreline. My sister and I climbed up the mountain to watch the sun set over the water. Remarkable.
